               <p>Currently I am working as Mainframe Cobol/CICS programmer/analysis.  I have been working through several system such as IBM 370 , ZOS , RPG/As400... Programming has always fascinated me. I remember my first program was to control a robot arm to pick up a block and put it in another place when I was in school, major Robotic Technology, gave me a great joy when it actually worked. Then I start working in business programming environment and enjoying coding ever since.  When coding I always try to code simple and efficiency, the way that is easy to understand for me and for maintaining later. Recently, I start to get curious about the codes behind those beautiful website and about those new programming language. I jump at the first chance when my company want to convert Mainframe to dot Net and really enjoy learning the new way to program in Object-oriented programming environment.
